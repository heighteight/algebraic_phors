Here some perspectives, suggesting that our result is just the first and most obvious one.

Extensions, e.g.~holonomic power series and restriction, e.g.~rational ones

Asymptotic estimations: a huge literature, can we use them to provide probability estimations?

Extracting properties of programs from the corresponding generating functions: factorization, recurrence properties, differential equations
