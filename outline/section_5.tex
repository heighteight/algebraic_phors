- rules of the type system

- interpretation in the model

- Theorem1: typable terms yields fps with finitely many non-zero coefficients, each coefficient is algebraic over $\mathbb Q$ 

- Theorem2: typable terms yields an algebraic power series

- Theorem3: AST is decidable (describe first-order formula for AST)

- Example1: order1 random walk, 

- Example2: $0^n1^n0^n$: order 2 non context-free but algebraic (both linear and non-linear)

- Example3: non-algebraic $0^n 1^{2^n}$ is not typable
