- discuss order 2 random walk: algebraic equations with power series coefficients correspond to admitting variables with infinite grade, but in a controlled way

- parametric polynomial equations and their solution

- Proposition 2. $n$ parametric polynomial equations in $n$ fps variables yield an algebraic fps

- extended type system

- Theorems 1/2/3 for the new type system, via Proposition 2
