	abstract = {Bounded linear types have proved to be useful for automated resource analysis and control in functional programming languages. In this paper we introduce a bounded linear typing discipline on a general notion of resource which can be modeled in a semiring. For this type system we provide both a general type-inference procedure, parameterized by the decision procedure of the semiring equational theory, and a coherent categorical semantics. This could be a useful type-theoretic and denotational framework for resource-sensitive compilation, and it represents a generalization of several existing type systems. As a non-trivial instance, motivated by hardware compilation, we present a complex new application to calculating and controlling timing of execution in a recursion-free higher-order functional programming language with local store.},

	abstract = {Linear logic is well known for its resource-awareness, which has inspired the design of several resource management mechanisms in programming language design. Its resource-awareness arises from the distinction between linear, single-use data and non-linear, reusable data. The latter is marked by the so-called exponential modality, which, from the categorical viewpoint, is a monoidal comonad.Monadic notions of computation are well-established mechanisms used to express effects in pure functional languages. Less well-established is the notion of comonadic computation. However, recent works have shown the usefulness of comonads to structure context dependent computations. In this work, we present a language <InlineEquation ID="IEq1"> <EquationSource Format="TEX">$ell mathcal{R}$</EquationSource> </InlineEquation> PCF inspired by a generalized interpretation of the exponential modality. In <InlineEquation ID="IEq2"> <EquationSource Format="TEX">$ell mathcal{R}$</EquationSource> </InlineEquation> PCF the exponential modality carries a label--an element of a semiring <InlineEquation ID="IEq3"> <EquationSource Format="TEX">$mathcal{R}$</EquationSource> </InlineEquation>--that provides additional information on how a program uses its context. This additional structure is used to express comonadic type analysis.},

	abstract = {We prove that the modal mu-calculus model-checking problem for (ranked and ordered) node-labelled trees that are generated by order- recursion schemes (whether safe or not, and whether homogeneously typed or not) is - EXPTIME complete, for every ngeqslant 0. It follows that the monadic second-order theories of these trees are decidable. There are three major ingredients. The first is a certain transference principle from the tree generated by the scheme - the value tree - to an auxiliary computation tree, which is itself a tree generated by a related order-0 recursion scheme (equivalently, a regular tree). Using innocent game semantics in the sense of Hyland and Ong, we establish a strong correspondence between paths in the value tree and traversals in the computation tree. This allows us to prove that a given alternating parity tree automaton (APT) has an (accepting) run-tree over the value tree iff it has an (accepting) traversal-tree over the computation tree. The second ingredient is the simulation of an (accepting) traversal-tree by a certain set of annotated paths over the computation tree; we introduce traversal-simulating APT as a recognising device for the latter. Finally, for the complexity result, we prove that traversal-simulating APT enjoy a succinctness property: for deciding acceptance, it is enough to consider run-trees that have a reduced branching factor. The desired bound is then obtained by analysing the complexity of solving an associated (finite) acceptance parity game.},

@article{10.1145/2159531.2159534,
	abstract = {Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs) are a natural abstract model of procedural probabilistic programs and related systems involving recursion and probability. They succinctly define a class of denumerable Markov chains that generalize several other stochastic models, and they are equivalent in a precise sense to probabilistic Pushdown Systems. In this article, we study the problem of model checking an RMC against an ω-regular specification, given in terms of a B\"{u}chi automaton or a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. Namely, given an RMC A and a property, we wish to know the probability that an execution of A satisfies the property. We establish a number of strong upper bounds, as well as lower bounds, both for qualitative problems (is the probability = 1, or = 0?), and for quantitative problems (is the probability ≥ p?, or, approximate the probability to within a desired precision). The complexity upper bounds we obtain for automata and LTL properties are similar, although the algorithms are different.We present algorithms for the qualitative model checking problem that run in polynomial space in the size |A| of the RMC and exponential time in the size of the property (the automaton or the LTL formula). For several classes of RMCs, including single-exit RMCs (a class that encompasses some well-studied stochastic models, for instance, stochastic context-free grammars) the algorithm runs in polynomial time in |A|. For the quantitative model checking problem, we present algorithms that run in polynomial space in the RMC and exponential space in the property. For the class of linearly recursive RMCs we can compute the exact probability in time polynomial in the RMC and exponential in the property. For deterministic automata specifications, all our complexities in the specification come down by one exponential.For lower bounds, we show that the qualitative model checking problem, even for a fixed RMC, is already EXPTIME-complete. On the other hand, even for simple reachability analysis, we know from our prior work that our PSPACE upper bounds in A can not be improved substantially without a breakthrough on a well-known open problem in the complexity of numerical computation.},

	abstract = {Turing Lecture from the winners of the 2007 ACM A.M. Turing Award.In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson, working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of model checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model---representing, for example, a hardware or software design---satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic (TL) formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem.The progression of model checking to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past 28 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a result many major hardware and software companies are beginning to use model checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits, communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems, and security algorithms.The work of Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms, and surprising theoretical results. Model checking tools, created by both academic and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance regarding the correctness of their initial designs. Model checking promises to have an even greater impact on the hardware and software industries in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Moshe Y. Vardi, Editor-in-Chief},

At the same time, recent work has demonstrated the possibility of interpreting higher-order probabilistic programming languages in the framework of tropical mathematics, by exploiting algebraic and categorical tools coming from the semantics of linear logic. In this work we combine these two worlds, showing that tools and ideas from tropical geometry can be used to perform statistical inference over higher-order probabilistic programs.   Notably, we first show that each such program can be associated with a degree and a n-dimensional polyhedron that encode its most likely runs. Then, we use these tools in order to design an intersection type system that estimates most likely runs in a compositional and efficient way.},
