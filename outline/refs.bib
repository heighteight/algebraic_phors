	abstract = {Program sensitivity measures how robust a program is to small changes in its input, and is a fundamental notion in domains ranging from differential privacy to cyber-physical systems. A natural way to formalize program sensitivity is in terms of metrics on the input and output spaces, requiring that an r-sensitive function map inputs that are at distance d to outputs that are at distance at most r · d. Program sensitivity is thus an analogue of Lipschitz continuity for programs. Reed and Pierce introduced Fuzz, a functional language with a linear type system that can express program sensitivity. They show soundness operationally, in the form of a metric preservation property. Inspired by their work, we study program sensitivity and metric preservation from a denotational point of view. In particular, we introduce metric CPOs, a novel semantic structure for reasoning about computation on metric spaces, by endowing CPOs with a compatible notion of distance. This structure is useful for reasoning about metric properties of programs, and specifically about program sensitivity. We demonstrate metric CPOs by giving a model for the deterministic fragment of Fuzz.},

@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2501-15637,
	abstract = {In the last few years there has been a growing interest towards methods for statistical inference and learning based on computational geometry and, notably, tropical geometry, that is, the study of algebraic varieties over the min-plus semiring. At the same time, recent work has demonstrated the possibility of interpreting higher-order probabilistic programming languages in the framework of tropical mathematics, by exploiting algebraic and categorical tools coming from the semantics of linear logic. In this work we combine these two worlds, showing that tools and ideas from tropical geometry can be used to perform statistical inference over higher-order probabilistic programs.   Notably, we first show that each such program can be associated with a degree and a n-dimensional polyhedron that encode its most likely runs. Then, we use these tools in order to design an intersection type system that estimates most likely runs in a compositional and efficient way.},
